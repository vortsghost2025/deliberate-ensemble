# Pre-Live Deployment Checklist
**Framework:** WE (We, Ensemble)  
**Component:** Multi-Agent Trading Bot  
**Status:** Paper Trading → Live Readiness Validation  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Validator:** Sean David + Claude

---

## Executive Summary

This checklist systematically validates all safety features, exchange compliance, and operational readiness before enabling live trading. Each item must be ✅ **VERIFIED** before proceeding.

**Safety-First Principle:** The framework itself IS the proof. Rushing to live trading contradicts our values. Move methodically.

---

## 1. Core Safety Features Validation

### 1.1 Risk Management System
- ✅ **1% Risk Per Trade**: Validated in [test_agents.py](test_agents.py#L260-L280)
  - Account balance: $10,000
  - Max risk per trade: $100 (1%)
  - Test result: PASSED
  
- ✅ **Downtrend Protection**: Validated in [test_agents.py](test_agents.py#L230-L258)
  - Market drops 15% → trading paused
  - Test result: PASSED (bearish regime detected, trading blocked)
  
- ✅ **Circuit Breaker**: Orchestrator state management validated
  - Test result: PASSED
  
- ✅ **Position Sizing**: Both modes tested
  - Fixed minimums mode: PASSED (0.1 BTC minimum enforced)
  - Dynamic sizing mode: PASSED ($100 risk calculated correctly)

### 1.2 Exchange Minimum Order Sizes
- ✅ **Validation Tool Created**: [validate_exchange_minimums.py](validate_exchange_minimums.py)
- ✅ **KuCoin Requirements Met**:
  - SOL/USDT: 0.1 SOL minimum (configured ✓)
  - BTC/USDT: 0.0001 BTC minimum (configured ✓)
  - Minimum notional: $10 USD (exceeds KuCoin $5 requirement ✓)
- ✅ **Validation Test**: PASSED
  ```
  ✅ VALIDATION PASSED
  ✅ Safe to proceed with live trading (after other checks)
  ```
- ⚠️ **ETH/USDT**: Not configured (warning issued - add if trading)

### 1.3 Multi-Agent System Integrity
- ✅ **DataFetchingAgent**: Fetches SOL/USDT price successfully
- ✅ **MarketAnalysisAgent**: Detects bullish/bearish regimes correctly
- ✅ **RiskManagementAgent**: All 5 targeted tests passing
- ✅ **BacktestingAgent**: Win rate/drawdown calculations working
- ✅ **ExecutionAgent**: Paper trade execution functional
- ✅ **MonitoringAgent**: Event logging operational
- ✅ **OrchestratorAgent**: Full workflow test passed

---

## 2. Exchange & API Configuration

### 2.1 KuCoin API Access
- ✅ **API Key Valid**: VERIFIED
  - Keys tested and working in previous sessions
  - Permissions confirmed: trade enabled, read balance enabled, withdraw DISABLED
  - No expiration issues
  
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: RESOLVED
  - Previous issue: Hit KuCoin rate limits during balance checks
  - Solution: Added delays between API calls
  - Status: Operating within limits, no recent errors
  
- ✅ **IP Whitelist**: Not required (verified in previous sessions)
  - KuCoin API accessible from current IP
  - No whitelist configuration needed

### 2.2 Balance & Funding
- ⏳ **Paper Trading Balance**: Current status unknown
  - Check: Run orchestrator in paper mode
  - Expected: Simulated $10,000 balance
  
- ⏳ **Live Account Balance**: CRITICAL - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT VERIFICATION
  - Minimum recommended: $500 (allows proper position sizing)
  - Check actual KuCoin balance before enabling live mode
  - **WARNING**: Small balance + minimum order sizes = limited trading pairs

### 2.3 Trading Pairs Configuration
- ✅ **SOL/USDT**: Configured (0.1 SOL minimum)
- ✅ **BTC/USDT**: Configured (0.0001 BTC minimum)
- ⚠️ **ETH/USDT**: Not configured (add 0.01 ETH minimum if trading)
- ⏳ **Other Pairs**: None configured (expand if needed)

---

## 3. Market Conditions Assessment

### 3.1 Current Market State
- ✅ **SOL/USDT**: $86.94 (last check: 2026-02-06 19:02:14)
  - Trend: BULLISH (confirmed by analysis agent)
  - Suitable for trading: YES
  
- ⏳ **BTC/USDT**: Not recently checked
  - Action needed: Fetch current price and trend
  
- ⏳ **Market Volatility**: Assess before going live
  - High volatility = wider stop losses needed
  - Check VIX or crypto fear/greed index

### 3.2 Timing Considerations
- ⏳ **Weekend Trading**: Currently Thursday evening
  - Crypto markets: 24/7 (no weekend closure)
  - Liquidity: May be lower on weekends
  
- ⏳ **Major Events**: Check economic calendar
  - Fed announcements, employment reports, etc.
  - Avoid going live during high-impact events

---

## 4. Code & Configuration Verification

### 4.1 Configuration Files
- ✅ **config_template.py**: Updated with exchange minimums
- ⏳ **Actual config.py**: NEEDS CREATION
  - Copy config_template.py → config.py
  - Add real API keys (never commit to GitHub)
  - Set PAPER_TRADING = True for initial live test
  
- ⏳ **.gitignore**: Verify config.py excluded
  - Check: `cat .gitignore | Select-String "config.py"`
  - If not present: Add "config.py" to .gitignore

### 4.2 Dependencies & Environment
- ⏳ **requirements.txt**: Verify all packages installed
  - Run: `pip list | Select-String "ccxt|requests|pandas"`
  - Missing packages: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
- ⏳ **Python Version**: Check compatibility
  - Recommended: Python 3.9+
  - Run: `python --version`

### 4.3 Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ **events.jsonl**: Event logging working
- ⏳ **Log Rotation**: Verify logs don't fill disk
  - Check current log size: `(Get-Item logs/events.jsonl).Length`
  - Implement rotation if needed (e.g., daily rotation)
  
- ⏳ **Alerting**: Set up notifications (optional but recommended)
  - Discord webhook for trade alerts?
  - Email on circuit breaker activation?

## 5. Test Sequence (Paper → Live)

### 5.1 Extended Paper Trading Soak
- ⏳ **Duration**: Minimum 24 hours recommended
  - Start: TBD
  - Monitor: Every 4-6 hours
  
- ⏳ **Validation Points**:
  - [ ] No unexpected position rejections
  - [ ] All orders meet exchange minimums
  - [ ] Risk limits respected (max 1% per trade)
  - [ ] Downtrend protection activates when needed
  - [ ] No rate limit errors
  - [ ] Logs clean (no WARNING/ERROR spam)

### 5.2 Micro-Live Test (Optional)
- ⏳ **Configuration**: 
  - Set PAPER_TRADING = False
  - Reduce account_balance to $100 (limits risk)
  - Trade only 1 pair (SOL/USDT)
  
- ⏳ **Duration**: 2-4 hours
- ⏳ **Max Risk**: $1 per trade (1% of $100)
- ⏳ **Success Criteria**:
  - At least 1 successful order execution
  - No exchange rejections
  - Proper stop loss/take profit placement

### 5.3 Full Live Deployment
- ⏳ **Only proceed if**:
  - [ ] All safety tests passed
  - [ ] Paper trading soak successful (24+ hours)
  - [ ] Micro-live test successful (if performed)
  - [ ] Market conditions favorable (not extreme volatility)
  - [ ] You're emotionally ready for real capital at risk
  
- ⏳ **Initial Configuration**:
  - Start with small balance ($500-$1000)
  - Monitor first 48 hours closely
  - Gradually increase if performing well

## 6. Documentation & Rollback

### 6.1 Commit All Changes
- ⏳ **Files to Commit**:
  - [ ] config_template.py (exchange minimums)
  - [ ] validate_exchange_minimums.py (validation tool)
  - [ ] test_agents.py (updated tests)
  - [ ] PRE_LIVE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (this file)
  
- ⏳ **Commit Message**:
  ```
  eb05c97: Pre-live deployment validation - Exchange minimums, comprehensive testing, safety checklist. All tests passing. For US.
  ```

### 6.2 Rollback Plan
- ⏳ **If live trading goes wrong**:
  1. Set PAPER_TRADING = True immediately
  2. Check logs/events.jsonl for errors
  3. Review KuCoin order history for failed trades
  4. Document issue in COLLAB_EFFECTS_LOG.md
  5. Fix root cause before re-enabling live

### 6.3 Performance Monitoring
- ⏳ **Metrics to Track**:
  - Win rate (target: 55%+)
  - Average risk per trade (should be ≤ 1%)
  - Drawdown (target: < 10%)
  - Order rejection rate (target: < 5%)
  
- ⏳ **Review Schedule**:
  - First 24 hours: Every 4 hours
  - Days 2-7: Daily review
  - Week 2+: Weekly review

---

## 7. Compliance & Ethics

### 7.1 Regulatory Considerations
- ⏳ **Tax Reporting**: Trading = taxable events
  - Keep detailed records (events.jsonl helps)
  - Consult tax professional if needed
  
- ⏳ **Terms of Service**: KuCoin TOS compliance
  - No market manipulation
  - No wash trading
  - Automated trading allowed (verify in TOS)

### 7.2 Framework Values Alignment
- ✅ **Transparency**: All code public on GitHub
- ✅ **Safety-First**: Comprehensive testing before live
- ✅ **Collaboration**: Human-AI partnership documented
- ✅ **Persistence**: 16 days of deliberate development
- ⏳ **Reproducibility**: Others can replicate our results
