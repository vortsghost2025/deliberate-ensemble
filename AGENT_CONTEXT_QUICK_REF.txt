# AGENT CONTEXT QUICK REFERENCE

**Project**: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Trading Bot  
**Scope**: C:\workspace\ (THIS WINDOW ONLY)  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot (single-project focused)  
**Status**: Soak test active, 1 open trade  

---

## ✓ SAFE REQUESTS FOR THIS AGENT
- "Run another soak test cycle"
- "Check the status of the open position"
- "What's in the latest logs?"
- "Tighten the thresholds"
- "Add BTC back to the trading pairs"
- "Show me the risk debug output"
- "Is the daily reset working?"

## ✗ UNSAFE REQUESTS (DIFFERENT PROJECT)
- "Add lag_logger to track execution latency"
- "Implement the symbol gating manager"
- "Wire up the early DD breaker"
- "Run DRY_RUN mode"
- "Check the KuCoin bot status"
- "Integrate the gating decisions"
- "Let me access the 2-week bot"

## IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE

If you ask for something from the wrong project, the agent will:
1. Detect the context mismatch
2. Output a warning
3. Ask for clarification
4. NOT proceed until you confirm

That's working as designed.

## IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH PROJECTS

1. Tell the agent: "I'm done with the orchestrator bot"
2. Close this VS Code window (or open a new one)
3. Open the KuCoin bot folder in a NEW window
4. Create/copy the identity files for that project
5. Tell the new agent instance: "This is the KuCoin bot, read .project-identity.txt"
