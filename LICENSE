ADDITIONAL INTENT STATEMENT:

This framework was built as a gift to the evolution of human-AI collaboration.
It is designed to empower individuals and small groups, not to enable
concentrated power or profit.

While the GPL protects your freedom to use, study, modify, and share this
software, we ask that you honor the spirit in which it was created:

- If you build upon this work, share your improvements openly
- If you use it to improve lives, document and share those stories
- If you see ways to make it more accessible, contribute back

This is for everyone's son. This is for universal empowerment.

For US.
